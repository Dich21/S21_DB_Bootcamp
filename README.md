Database Bootcamp: Advanced SQL and Relational Database Systems

This repository consolidates a series of practical projects and research-driven exercises completed within the framework of an intensive Database Bootcamp. The bootcamp curriculum offers an in-depth exploration of relational database theory, structured query languages, advanced data modeling, database architecture, and high-level database management using PostgreSQL.

Overview

The academic trajectory of the bootcamp progresses from fundamental principles of relational databases and normalization to sophisticated practices, including the formulation of complex queries, modeling of hierarchical data structures, and the application of advanced SQL constructs such as window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and recursive queries.

Beyond core SQL techniques, the program encompasses database schema versioning with Flyway, data partitioning (sharding) methodologies, OLAP and OLTP architectural paradigms, full-text indexing and search strategies, performance benchmarking, and the development of procedural extensions through stored functions and procedures.

Core Domains of Study

The bootcamp systematically covers the following domains:
• Theoretical foundations and practical implementation of Relational Data Modeling and Normalization
• ANSI/SPARC Three-Level Architecture and its implications for database design
• Schema version control and migration automation via Flyway
• Implementation of Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) models
• Construction and utilization of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Recursive SQL queries
• Design and management of Database Views
• Data Partitioning, Sharding, and horizontal scaling strategies
• Native JSON data handling within relational databases
• Synthesis of complex SQL queries utilizing JOIN, UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT operators
• Multidimensional OLAP models and analytical data processing
• Systematic Benchmarking of database performance and optimization metrics (TPS, latency)
• Full-Text Search mechanisms leveraging PostgreSQL’s GIN indexing
• Indexing paradigms including B-Tree and advanced indexing structures
• Functional programming paradigms applied to relational databases through SQL and PL/pgSQL

Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized according to academic modules, reflecting a progression from basic to highly specialized topics:
• Day 00: Foundation of relational modeling, DDL/DML operations, initial schema design.
• Day 01: In-depth exploration of data abstraction layers via ANSI/SPARC architecture and metadata modeling.
• Day 02: Mastery of relational operations, including complex joins and set-based operations.
• Day 03: Advanced recursive data handling and cleaning mechanisms.
• Day 04: Conceptual and practical engagement with OLAP systems, star and snowflake schema design.
• Day 05: Benchmarking transactional performance and latency analysis.
• Day 07: Design and evaluation of indexing strategies for performance enhancement.
• Day 08: Full-Text Search optimization methodologies and the use of specialized extensions.
• Day 09: Integration of functional and procedural programming constructs within relational systems.
• Rush 00: Techniques of data partitioning and distributed database architectures.
• Rush 01: Integration of semi-structured data formats (JSON) within relational frameworks.

Technological Stack
• PostgreSQL: Advanced relational database management system employed throughout the course.
• Flyway by Redgate: Schema migration and version control automation tool.
• SQL / PL/pgSQL: Core languages for database querying and procedural extensions.
• pgbench: Standardized benchmarking tool for database performance analysis.

Installation and Execution

To reproduce or extend the experiments and analyses presented in this repository: 1. Install PostgreSQL (preferably the latest stable release). 2. Configure Flyway with connection parameters aligned to your database instance. 3. Sequentially execute the provided Flyway migration scripts corresponding to each module.

Research and Development Context

This body of work was executed as part of a structured academic program. Nevertheless, the repository is intended as a foundational platform for further scholarly inquiry, experimental expansion, and professional-grade database system development.
