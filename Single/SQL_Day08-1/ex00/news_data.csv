But instead of basking in the glory of Brooklyn's fourth win in five outings, Harden kept talking about improvement.

""You [can] never be complacent. I can't be complacent,"" he said. ""I've never been like that, and I won't start now. I think I can always be better. I think when you're trying to accomplish something, first, you've got to look in the mirror, look at yourself, see what things you can do better and ways you can contribute in a better way for the betterment of the team.""

He's done that for sure, while simultaneously kicking open the door for entry into the top five of this week's Kia Race to the MVP Ladder.

Since Harden debuted with the Nets on Jan. 16, the team owns a record of 26-7 in games he's played."

Matthews leads the NHL with 24 goals in 33 games and has scored six points (three goals, three assists) in his past four.

"https://datalaboratory.one","Flajolet-Martin algorithm","Hi there!

Sometimes, we need to know how many UNIQUE rows exist in a table. In a Relational Database World there is a simple but high-costly action for DB engine level (for example DISTINCT or GROUP BY with subquery). The simple business case for that action is to get an amount of unique users who visited your web-site during a period of time.

SELECT count(t1.user_id) AS ""Unique users""
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT(user_id) AS user_id
FROM visits
WHERE visit_date BETWEEN date1 AND date2) AS t1;

In the modern era of Big Data, Streaming Data, IoT we often face the speed of our request to the database and honestly we do not need to get the exact amount of unique users at the period of time. Just an approximate number is enough for our needs. To help us with our task we can use a really awesome probabilistic structure.

Let me present an example of Flajolet-Martin algorithm (aka ""FM"" or ""LogLog counting of large cardinalities"")"

In this all-knockout season, the last before the introduction of a group stage for 2021/22, Sam Mewis's consolation strike as Manchester City were knocked out by Barcelona in the quarter-finals lifted her level on five goals with the Spanish side's Jenni Hermoso.

There are seven other players on four goals, including three still involved in the competition: Lyon's Melvine Malard, Chelsea's Fran Kirby and Barcelona forward Asisat Oshoala."

Andreescu, into her first championship clash since triumphing at the 2019 US Open, will play No. 1-ranked Ashleigh Barty for the first time for the WTA 1000 title on Saturday.

""Yeah, I've wanted to play her for a long time now, so I'm super excited for that,"" the world No. 9 said. ""I know it'll be a really tough match, but I'm really looking forward to it.""

Her semifinal with Sakkari, which began late Thursday night, was full of momentum swings. It started right away in the first set, where Andreescu let a 4-1 lead slip away and faced two set points in the tie-break, down 6-5 and 7-6. She saved the first one with an unreturnable serve out wide and the second with a barrage of big backhands, then rifled a crosscourt backhand winner to sneak out the first set after exactly an hour.

The Canadian then opened up a 3-1 lead in the second set---but that's where things turned again.

Sakkari would win five straight games, and nine of the next 11, to not only take the second set, but build a 4-2 lead in the decider. Andreescu dug in, winning the next three games to go up 5-4, but Sakkari struck right back, holding for 5-all---then breaking for 6-5 and a chance to serve out the match."
